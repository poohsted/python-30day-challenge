## ✅ What I’ve Learned

### 🧠 Day 8: Loops and Battery Simulation
- `while` loops for continuous actions
- Simulating robot battery drain
- Real-time feedback using `time.sleep()`

### 🧠 Day 9: File I/O (Write, Read, Append)
- Writing and reading plain text files
- Using `with open(...)` for safe file access
- Appending user input to a log file
- Formatting timestamps using `datetime`

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Day 10: Start working with data from external APIs
- Build more real-world mini projects and document them
