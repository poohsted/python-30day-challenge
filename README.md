## ‚úÖ What I‚Äôve Learned

### üß† Day 1: List Comprehensions
- Fast and readable way to create lists
- Used filtering and conditions
```python
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

---

### üß† Day 2: Strings, Functions, and Testing
- Practiced string slicing, formatting, and file writing
- Wrote functions and understood local vs global scope
- Used file I/O with `open()`, `write()`, and `read()`
- Performed simple unit-like tests using `==`

---

### üß† Day 3: Modules & Error Handling
- Learned how to organize code with multiple files (modules)
- Created helper functions in `utils.py`
- Imported and reused functions in `day3_main.py`
- Practiced exception handling using `try`, `except`, `finally`

---

### üß† Day 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

#### ‚úÖ Part 1: Classes and Objects
- Defined custom classes using `class`
- Used the `__init__` constructor to create object attributes
- Wrote methods like `.speak()` that belong to objects
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, sound):
        self.name = name
        self.sound = sound

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says {self.sound}"

dog = Animal("Dog", "Woof")
print(dog.speak())  # Dog says Woof
```

#### ‚úÖ Part 2: Inheritance
- Created subclasses that inherit from a base class
- Used `super()` to call parent class constructors
- Extended base class behavior with new methods
```python
class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name, "Woof")
        self.breed = breed

    def fetch(self):
        return f"{self.name} is fetching!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(my_dog.speak())  # Buddy says Woof
print(my_dog.fetch())  # Buddy is fetching!
```

---

### üß† Day 5: Files, CSV, and JSON

#### ‚úÖ Text File I/O
- Opened files with `open()`, wrote and read lines
- Used context managers (`with open(...) as f:`) to auto-close files
```python
with open("hello.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello from Day 5!\n")
```

#### ‚úÖ CSV Handling
- Read tabular data using the `csv` module
- Wrote CSV files with custom headers
```python
import csv

with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Score"])
    writer.writerow(["Pooh", 100])
```

#### ‚úÖ JSON Handling
- Serialized Python dictionaries to JSON
- Loaded JSON data into Python objects
```python
import json

data = {"robot": "A1", "status": "active"}
with open("data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
```

#### ü§ñ AI & Robotics Use Case
- Learned how to log sensor data in CSV format
- Stored robot configurations and AI model settings using JSON
- Practiced reading structured data for automation tasks

---

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Day 6: Explore functions and modules deeply
- Use functions to structure robotics simulation logic
- Keep refining Git & documentation habits
