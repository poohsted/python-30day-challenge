## ✅ What I’ve Learned

### 🧠 Day 1: List Comprehensions
- Fast and readable way to create lists
- Used filtering and conditions
```python
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

### 🧠 Day 2: Strings, Functions, and Testing
String slicing, formatting, and file writing

Function scopes: global, local

Simple test cases with == comparisons

### 🧠 Day 3: Modules & Error Handling
Created reusable functions in utils.py

Used import to keep code clean

Handled exceptions using try, except, and finally
